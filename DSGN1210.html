<p>... is a really good tool to have in your web developers kit. You can use it to do compositions of new web sites, to create transparent pngs and gifs. Even for animation sequences. We will look at photoshop in the context of making mobile compositions, culminating in using it for a project proposal.</p>

<p>If you are just starting to do software development now, mobile is your big
opportunity! When my dad started developing software in the early 1970s cash
registers were being networked with the mainframe computers of the time to
revolutionize big retailers with new information. People like my dad were
required to help make that happen. When I started developing software in the
early 90s ubiquitous microcomputers, legacy mainframes and everything in between
were being networked together to share information on the internet that would
change the world.</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Responsive_Web_Design.png" alt="Mobile First" title="Image by Muhammad Rafizeldi" /></p>

<p>Now, another 20 years later people are networked on their
couch, in their car, even in the bathroom thanks to mobile. In the same way that
my dad and I were needed to make the networked information of our times
available, today's software developers are required to build out the mobile trend. I
hope that developing the software that people will use in the next 20 years will
be as much fun for you as it has been for my dad and I.</p>

<div class="editable" id="articles/PhotoshopProject_md"><h1>Photoshop Project</h1>

<p>On Friday I would like you to pitch a new website to the class and I. I would like the pitch to be backed by a .psd demo and a proposal letter. The demo needs to include screens for at least 320x480 and a desktop experience. I put a couple of sample letters on the desire to learn page.</p>

<p>One approach that you might take is a responsive redesign of a website such as http://fox.com like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRwFo4L2CLo">the demo I showed in class</a>. In the demo he uses an OSX program called paparazzi. There is a better addon for firefox called Screen Grab. If you use it with the web developer tools, you can grab screens at various resolutions as well as an entire screen as a png. Following is a screenshot of my firefox showing the 2 plugins:</p>

<p><img src="images/FirefoxAddins.png" alt="firefox plugins" title="My Firefox Plugins" /></p>

<p>You can add new addons to firefox by clicking on the <code>Firefox</code> orange button in the top left corner of the screen. Select <code>Add-ons</code> and type the name of the addon you are searching for in the search bar.
The http://fox.com also included some mobile widgets. You can get widgets from a psd file at <a href="http://www.bentdesignstudio.com/v2/2012/03/twitter-bootstrap-2-photoshop-template-psd/">this page</a>, but you could also use <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.1/">jquery mobile widgets</a>. There is also a <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/getting-started.html#examples">bootstrap demo site here</a>. <em>Hint:</em> Show the bootstrap or jquery mobile examples in the resize web developer tool to get the look for a mobile device.</p>

<p>I posted some actual letters on the desire to learn page, but here is a sample more generic letter that you might use:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>August 23, 2013</p>

  <p><code>name of offerer</code></p>

  <p><code>email of offerer</code></p>

  <p><code>name of prospect</code></p>

  <p><code>email of prospect</code></p>

  <p>Dear <code>prospect</code>:</p>

  <p>Thank you for the opportunity to work on your project. I think you have a great idea because <code>...</code>. It was a pleasure meeting with you a few weeks ago and talking about your vision. I look forwards to working with you while implementing your ideas.</p>

  <p>OBJECTIVE</p>

  <p>Implement a website that is a platform for your vision. Show you how you use the website and maintain it for the future.</p>

  <p>SCOPE OF SERVICES</p>

  <p>Installation and setup.</p>

  <p>Social media links to your social media sites.</p>

  <p>Registration of the domain name and activation to your site.</p>

  <p>Training and Support until October 31, 2013 for getting content on the site</p>

  <p>IMPLEMENTATION AND SUPPORT FEES</p>

  <p>The total cost of the project will be $XXX, payable by XXXXX.</p>

  <p>Thank-you for the opportunity to work on this exciting project. The project will be implemented in workshop style, upon sending of an email money transfer.</p>

  <p>Sincerely</p>

  <p><code>offeror</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The materials given are not intended as constraints or even particularly as examples. <em>Please</em> demonstrate <em>your</em> vision for a website and how you would sell it to a customer. The .psd files and the offer letter in word or pdf format need to be submitted to desire to learn by September 26th 2014 at midnight. The demo is Friday the 26th during class time.</p>

<div class="editable" id="articles/Vectors_md"><h1>Vectors</h1>

<p>In class there was a discussion about people ordering signs and other large
print media and suggesting that "Just use the logo from our Website" is a way to
get a logo. Many website graphics are raster or bitmap graphics. Bitmap graphics
when enlarged on a sign or even in PowerPoint can look terrible! Paradoxically
bitmap graphics can also look "jaggy" when they are shrunk in size. The vector
image format that can be displayed natively on IE9 and other browsers on the web
is a scalable vector graphic (svg). Let me share a "User Story" on SVG.</p>

<p>I love WebRTC and think that it is the future of non in-person communications.
When I was looking to do some PowerPoint on the topic I came across the first
logo below. Unfortunately it looked terrible on my PowerPoint. SVG to the rescue!</p>

<p><img src="images/customLogo.gif.png" alt="&quot;Original with bitmap&quot;" title="Original with bitmap" /></p>

<p><img src="images/webrtc-long.svg" alt="&quot;New with SVG&quot;" title="New with SVG" /></p>

<p>The good news is that the graphic looks much sharper as a .svg. The bad news
was that for it to render correctly in Chrome and Firefox I had to use a "web
safe" font (Comic Sans MS). There is a list of
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/jmorzins/www/fonts.html">web safe fonts here.</a></p>

<p>To convert a graphic from a bitmap to a vector in Adobe Fireworks.</p>

<ol>
<li>Click on a uniformly colored area with the eyedropper tool to pick up the color for the fill.</li>
<li>Click on the same area with the magic wand.</li>
<li>Right Mouse over the selected area (your cursor will change)</li>
<li>Select <code>Modify Marquee</code> and <code>Convert To Path</code></li>
<li>Repeat until all of the paths are displayed in layers above the bitmap.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: you can turn off displaying the bitmap behind to see as your work progresses.</p>

<p>Vector graphics that can be displayed natively on the web are in the .svg
format. You can possibly get a nice svg by navigating to the <code>Commands</code> menu,
selecting <code>Export</code> and the <code>Export SVG</code> . For a complex path this had
disappointing results. Instead I ended up saving the image in .ai (adobe
illustrator) format. In adobe illustrator I could save the image as an svg.</p>

<p>This is a more complex path that my wife commissioned my son to do so that on her cards she could have pets peeking out of the letters in her name.</p>

<p><img src="images/BensDogsAndCats.svg" alt="&quot;Completed Pets&quot;" title="Completed Pets" /></p>

<p>The original, as scanned on a multi-purpose printer looked like this:</p>

<p><img src="images/BensDogAndCat.fw.png" alt="&quot;Scanned Original&quot;" title="Scanned Original" /></p>
