<div class="bookmark"><div class="editable" id="articles/INFO2120WhyCMS_md"><h1>Why use a CMS</h1>

<p>Possibly in a moment of frustration, a person new to Drupal said, "Why do we use a CMS again?" The best reason to use a CMS is that it separates content from its presentation in a way that allows the development team to maintain control over the presentation of the content while allowing the end user to create the content itself. Drupal does an imperfect job of this in that some structural things like page templates and stylesheets are in code, while other structural items like menus, blocks and views are stored in the database.</p>
</div></div>

<hr />
<div id="links" class="bookmark"><div class="editable" id="articles/INFO2120Links_md"><h1>Links and Images</h1>

<p>We started out with links by looking at a simple example for the Riverssoft web site. Tony wanted to have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9DqEM92Sdg">video embedded in a page on his site from youtube</a>. Embedding the video in the site was super easy. We just went to the page on youtube, clicked on sharing and copied the iframe from the embed tab:</p>

<p><img src="images/INFO2120videoEmbed.png" alt="embed tab" title="embed tab" /></p>

<p>Before making a new page on the site, we need to think about how much control over the site we want to give to the customer. If we are embedding the video on a static page and not a blog entry, I would argue that this is a setup activity rather than one that the user should be doing. If the user can make new static pages and add them to the menu, the menu will quickly become unwieldy. If users are given full html access then they will be able to change the look and feel of the site, which is what <em>you</em> were asked to do. My suggestion is that you leave adding static pages as an administrative function and also restrict use of full html to the administrator.</p>

<p>To add a new page with a video embedded to the site:</p>

<ol>
<li>log on as administrator.</li>
<li>go to Add Content/Basic Page</li>
<li>make sure that you have the <code>full html</code> filter selected</li>
<li>past the iframe from the embed video into the page</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="images/INFO2120AddBasicPage.png" alt="full html" title="full html" /></p>

<p>It is helpful, to add whatever text you need at the same time so that you can see the iframe code. It is also important to note that when you add a page like this the html for the page itself is stored in the database, not in your code for the site. The video itself remains on youtube. The asset chain is as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li>template resources such as css, logos and other images come from the <code>sites/all/themes</code> folder</li>
<li>the template pulls in the menu and blocks of the page from the database, structured by a page.tpl.php file</li>
<li>the basic page node in the database contains an iframe for your video on youtube</li>
<li>when the browser renders the iframe it pulls the content from youtube</li>
</ol>

<p>Similarly in class we added google calendar iframes using almost the exact same process.</p>

<p><img src="images/INFO2120GoogleCalendar.png" alt="google calendar" title="google calendar" /></p>

<ol>
<li>on your calendar page go to it's settings</li>
<li>under <code>my calendars</code> click on the calendar you would like to embed</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="images/INFO2120MyCalendars.png" alt="my calendars" title="my calendars" /></p>

<ol start="3">
<li>the actual embed code is midway down the screen</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="images/INFO2120EmbedCalendar.png" alt="embed calendar" title="embed calendar" /></p>

<p>Finally, a topic that we all struggled with was embedding images in basic pages. There is a pre-built module for doing this that is already part of the article content type.</p>

<p><img src="images/INFO2120ArticleContentType.png" alt="Basic Page Image" title="Basic page image" /></p>

<p>You can add this field as an existing field to your basic page content type as well. It is also possible to use the ckeditor module to upload images, although not suggested. Once you have the image(s) associated with your page the preferred way of styling them is to use CSS. We will talk more about styling with CSS when we come to theming. That way some consistency of look and feel can be achieved. Another important lever for maintaining consistency of look and feel is the <code>manage display</code> tab.</p>

<p><img src="images/INFO2120ManageAppearance.png" alt="manage display" title="manage display" /></p>

<p>Using this you can get the image displayed first, get consistent size so that the positioning of the image can be controlled by css. Finally, a number of teams employed the disqus module in their site for authenticated comments without users having to sign in to the site.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/disqus">disqus module</a> can be used to replace drupal comments with social media style comments that are centrally managed by a cloud service. The documentation is excellent, except it doesn't really mention how to get rid of Drupal comments. To get rid of Drupal comments:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pick the content type under Structure/Content Types</li>
<li>Set commenting to <code>closed</code> for that content type</li>
<li>If necessary, find existing content with that content type and also set commenting to closed for the existing comments.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have really only scratched the surface of the wide range of content options. Depending on your goals, Drupal has modules for  almost anything. The ones I have highlighted are suitable for a pamphlet plus blog style website wich is what most people have done for their customer.</p>
</div></div>

<hr />
<div id="pages" class="bookmark">
    <div class="editable" id="articles/INFO2120Pages_md"><h1>Pages</h1>

<p>The overall navigation of your site is managed by a menu structure that is changeable under Structure/Menus. As we saw when we looked at links and images, a page can be added to the menu structure by checking <code>Provide a menu link</code> when the page is edited.</p>

<p>In a pamphlet plus blog kind of scenario, which Drupal is particularly good at, we make the home page without adding it to the menu. Then to set this page as the home page one navigates to Configuration/Site Information and puts the number of the node as the default front page:</p>

<p><img src="images/INFO2120DefaultFrontPage.png" alt="default front page" title="default front page" /></p>

<p>When additional static/basic pages are added the <code>Provide a menu link</code> checkbox is checked. That leaves the structure of the blog page.</p>

<p>To structure the blog page, the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/views">Views module is required</a>. The views module also has a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/ctools">dependency on ctools</a>. When the module is installed and activated in the normal way, you will have an <code>Views</code> choice under <code>Structure</code>. To create the Blog View:</p>

<p><img src="images/INFO2120Views.png" alt="add a view" title="add a view" /></p>

<ol>
<li>add a view</li>
<li>select show content of type <code>article</code></li>
<li>select <code>Create a Page</code></li>
<li>select <code>Create a Menu Link</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Once your static pages and views are the way that you want them, you can reorder them by going to Structure/Menus and dragging and dropping them into place.</p>
</div></div>

<hr />
<div class="bookmark">
    <div class="editable" id="articles/INFO2120Permissions_md"><h1>Permissions</h1>

<p>When creating a pamphlet plus blog type of web site for a customer, it may be a good idea to restrict the customer's access to adding new articles. If a customer adds new pages or forms she may impact overall usability of the site. Drupal comes with built in site search capability, but it is only available to the administrator by default.</p>

<p>Controlling permissions is done by navigating to <code>People</code> and then to the permissions tab. The permissions look like:</p>

<p><img src="images/INFO2120Permissions.png" alt="Permissions" title="Permissions" /></p>

<p>Note how <code>Use Search</code> is only allowed to the administrator. To have the search available to all users the anonymous and authenticated users would also need to be checked. Notice that along with permissions there is also a roles tab. To create a user that can only do blogging, I made a role "blogger" and created a user with that role. The blogger only has the article content or node type available to them:</p>

<p><img src="images/INFO2120Blogger.png" alt="Blogger" title="Permissions" /></p>

<p>Controlling the node types available to a role, also simplifies the choices a user must make to add the appropriate content, and reduces the learning curve for the user.</p>
</div></div>

<div id="home" class="bookmark">
        <div class="editable" id="articles/INFO2120Home_md"><h1>How to use Drupal for your Home Page</h1>

<p>In <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/drupal-for-education-and-elearning-2e/book">the text, Drupal for Education and E-learning</a>, the authors Robinson and Fitzgerald make a good case for using drupal as a social media tool for learning. Often educators will have a home directory available to them on a machine running the apache web server, which often also has php installed. If this is the case, then it is quite easy to make Drupal handle the content on your home page.</p>

<h2>Prepare the Server</h2>

<p>You may not have much control over this but the following are the pre-requisites on a Ubuntu server:</p>

<ol>
<li>php5-curl and php5-gd debian packages installed  </li>
<li>enabled userdir, php5, rewrite apache modules</li>
<li>a public_html folder inside your home folder with group www-data and permissions 2750 (2 is for the setgid bit)</li>
<li>a mysql schema, for which you have the username and password</li>
</ol>

<h2>Download and Configure Drupal</h2>

<ol>
<li>Download and extract Drupal to a folder on your desktop</li>
<li><p>Edit the <code>.htaccess</code> file in the top level folder</p>

<pre><code># Modify the RewriteBase if you are using Drupal in a subdirectory or in a
# VirtualDocumentRoot and the rewrite rules are not working properly.
# For example if your site is at http://example.com/drupal uncomment and
# modify the following line:
# RewriteBase /drupal
RewriteBase /~your_username
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Copy the sites/default/default.settings.php to sites/default/settings.php</p></li>
<li>Use a program like filezilla to copy the contents of the top level Drupal folder to your public_html folder on the Ubuntu host.</li>
<li>Browse to http://host/~your_username and go through the screens to do the initial setup of drupal</li>
<li>Make sure to note down the username you enter in the last step</li>
</ol>

<h2>Add the markdown module</h2>

<p>Github and Stack Overflow have popularized the markdown syntax for creating content. It is important because syntax like markdown separates content from formatting. Control over formatting can the be maintained by the project team, with control over the content being handed over to the customer.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the markdown module <a href="https://drupal.org/project/markdown">from here</a>.</li>
<li>Expand markdown on to your desktop like drupal itself and copy it to the <code>sites/all/modules</code> folder</li>
<li>Enable the module by going to administration/modules and checking the markdown check boxes</li>
<li>Add a text format for markdown under administration/configuration/text formats</li>
</ol>

<h2>Add the gauth module</h2>

<p>Part of the appeal of using Drupal for education and e-learning is the interactivity of the medium. Using the Gauth module anyone with google plus credentials can participate in your site without being added individually. With non-anonimity of comments people will tend to contribute constructively.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://drupal.org/project/gauth">gauth module</a> is dependent on the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/libraries">libraries api module</a> as well as a <a href="http://google-api-php-client.googlecode.com/files/google-api-php-client-0.6.0.tar.gz">google php client</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Expand the libraries api module on to your desktop and copy it to <code>sites/all/modules</code></li>
<li>Enable the libraries module and create a <code>sites/all/libraries</code> folder</li>
<li>Expand and copy the google php client to the <code>sites/all/libraries</code> folder</li>
<li>Expand and copy the gauth module to the <code>sites/all/modules</code> folder</li>
</ol>

<p>The gauth module depends on the page owner to establish an account with google, as well as the page visitor. A visitor and owner that are unknown to each other but both known to google can then interact securely.</p>

<p>The page owner signs up for this by going to the <a href="https://code.google.com/apis/console">apis console</a>.  You will need to create a project from which you will need:</p>

<p><img src="images/redactedGoogleApi.png" alt="values copied from here" title="values copied from here" /></p>

<p>You will need to paste these values into the <code>Administration/Configuration/Google Login Settings</code>.</p>

<p>If all goes well you will see a <code>login with google</code> button on your homepage. When you follow it you will be logged in and can see what a non administrator sees on your page.</p>
</div></div>

<div id="theming" class="bookmark">
            <div class="editable" id="articles/INFO2120Theming_md"><h1>Drupal Themes</h1>

<p>A powerful idea of Dupal is that as a content management system it separates content from presentation This is an important division of labor, because it allows customers to manage content while the presentation of that content can be kept under control of the project team. The basic themes that come with Drupal can also be supplemented with custom themes that can be made by designers or by the project team themselves.</p>

<p>One such designer theme is the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/bootstrap">Bootstrap 3.0 theme</a>. When themes are installed in Drupal:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download and extract the theme to your desktop</li>
<li>Upload the theme to the sites/all/themes folder</li>
<li>Set the theme as the default by going to <code>Administration/Appearance</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>Blocks</h2>

<p>The templates for themes have a block structure. These blocks are often defined in a node.tpl.php and page.tpl.php file for the theme. For instance the built in Garland theme has the page.tpl.php:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
?&gt;
  &lt;?php print render($page['header']); ?&gt;

  &lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;
    &lt;div id="container" class="clearfix"&gt;

      &lt;div id="header"&gt;
        &lt;div id="logo-floater"&gt;
        &lt;?php if ($logo || $site_title): ?&gt;
          &lt;?php if ($title): ?&gt;
            &lt;div id="branding"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="&lt;?php print $front_page ?&gt;"&gt;
            &lt;?php if ($logo): ?&gt;
              &lt;img src="&lt;?php print $logo ?&gt;" alt="&lt;?php print $site_name_and_slogan ?&gt;" title="&lt;?php print $site_name_and_slogan ?&gt;" id="logo" /&gt;
            &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
            &lt;?php print $site_html ?&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;?php else: /* Use h1 when the content title is empty */ ?&gt;
            &lt;h1 id="branding"&gt;&lt;a href="&lt;?php print $front_page ?&gt;"&gt;
            &lt;?php if ($logo): ?&gt;
              &lt;img src="&lt;?php print $logo ?&gt;" alt="&lt;?php print $site_name_and_slogan ?&gt;" title="&lt;?php print $site_name_and_slogan ?&gt;" id="logo" /&gt;
            &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
            &lt;?php print $site_html ?&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
        &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;?php if ($primary_nav): print $primary_nav; endif; ?&gt;
        &lt;?php if ($secondary_nav): print $secondary_nav; endif; ?&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /#header --&gt;

      &lt;?php if ($page['sidebar_first']): ?&gt;
        &lt;div id="sidebar-first" class="sidebar"&gt;
          &lt;?php print render($page['sidebar_first']); ?&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;

      &lt;div id="center"&gt;&lt;div id="squeeze"&gt;&lt;div class="right-corner"&gt;&lt;div class="left-corner"&gt;
          &lt;?php print $breadcrumb; ?&gt;
          &lt;?php if ($page['highlighted']): ?&gt;&lt;div id="highlighted"&gt;&lt;?php print render($page['highlighted']); ?&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
          &lt;a id="main-content"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;?php if ($tabs): ?&gt;&lt;div id="tabs-wrapper" class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
          &lt;?php print render($title_prefix); ?&gt;
          &lt;?php if ($title): ?&gt;
            &lt;h1&lt;?php print $tabs ? ' class="with-tabs"' : '' ?&gt;&gt;&lt;?php print $title ?&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
          &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
          &lt;?php print render($title_suffix); ?&gt;
          &lt;?php if ($tabs): ?&gt;&lt;?php print render($tabs); ?&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
          &lt;?php print render($tabs2); ?&gt;
          &lt;?php print $messages; ?&gt;
          &lt;?php print render($page['help']); ?&gt;
          &lt;?php if ($action_links): ?&gt;&lt;ul class="action-links"&gt;&lt;?php print render($action_links); ?&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
          &lt;div class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;?php print render($page['content']); ?&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;?php print $feed_icons ?&gt;
          &lt;?php print render($page['footer']); ?&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /.left-corner, /.right-corner, /#squeeze, /#center --&gt;

      &lt;?php if ($page['sidebar_second']): ?&gt;
        &lt;div id="sidebar-second" class="sidebar"&gt;
          &lt;?php print render($page['sidebar_second']); ?&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /#container --&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /#wrapper --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can see from the blocks screenshot how the template lays out the blocks:</p>

<p><img src="images/INFO2120Blocks.png" alt="blocks" title="Blocks" /></p>

<p>A heavy handed way of changing a theme would be to edit that page.tpl.php. This can be avoided by instead moving content among the blocks, or disabling content altogether by setting it's block to <code>none</code>. Once you have the content in the blocks that you want it in, you can refine the appearance with css.</p>

<p>Theme CSS can be overridden be adding a new css file to the <themename>.info file.</p>

<pre><code>name = Garland
description = A multi-column theme which can be configured to modify colors and switch between fixed and fluid width layouts.
package = Core
version = VERSION
core = 7.x
stylesheets[all][] = style.css
stylesheets[print][] = print.css
settings[garland_width] = fluid

; Information added by Drupal.org packaging script on 2014-07-24
version = "7.30"
project = "drupal"
datestamp = "1406239730"
</code></pre>

<p>For instance <code>stylesheets[all][] = rich.css</code>. Getting the blocks the way that you want them and then overriding some css, is a much less heavy handed way of customizing a theme. When you first add a stylesheet to a theme, you usually have to switch to another default theme, and then switch back to the them that you are modifying so that the .info file is re-read.</p>

<p>A lot of people, when they think of having a web presence, think of selling things with that web presence. Especially when starting out, PayPal is a very good choice as there is no monthly fee. Instead of a monthly fee there is a per transaction fee as well as a percentage. Like most payment tools PayPal has a sandbox that can be used to experiment with and code a user interface, without spending real money. To use the sandbox, you <a href="https://www.paypal.com/ca/webapps/mpp/home">sign up for a merchant account here.</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have a merchant account, you can go <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/">here to set up a sandbox buyer and seller.</a></p>

<ol>
<li>Follow the <code>Applications</code> hyperlink.</li>
<li>Go to the <code>sandbox accounts</code> hyperlink.</li>
<li><code>Create account</code>(s) by clicking on the button.</li>
<li>Make sure to give the buyer a $1000 paypal balance.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you have buyer and seller accounts, you can <a href="https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/ca/webapps/mpp/home">go here to create product buttons</a>. Login as the seller that you just created. Creating product buttons isn't as straightforward as one might think. The easiest way that I have found is to click on the <code>profile</code> hyperlink:</p>

<p>Once on the profile screen, you can create product buttons by clicking on the <code>My Saved Buttons</code> hyperlink:</p>

<p><img src="images/PaypalProfileChoices.png" alt="saved buttons" title="saved buttons" />.</p>

<p>When you have created a product button, you can get a short url for the button by switching to the email tab while viewing the code for your button:</p>

<p><img src="images/PayPalEmailTab.png" alt="email code" title="email tab" /></p>

<p>Please also note the hyperlink to create a <code>View Cart</code> button on this screen. You only need to create one view cart button that you can use anywhere in your "store". Again the view cart button hyperlink can be accessed through the email tab. For goods that can be fulfilled electronically there is also an opportunity to set a success page:</p>

<p><img src="images/PayPalAdvanced.png" alt="success page" title="success page" /></p>

<p>To keep your electronic goods from being stolen this should be a dynamic page that at least checks the referrer page, before giving a link to download the electronic goods.</p>

<p>Once I have created product buttons on paypal it is up to me to link them with descriptions and pictures of items for sale: <img src="https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_cart_LG.gif" alt="a sunny morning" title="a sunny morning" /></p>

<pre><code>&lt;form target="paypal" action="https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post"&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick"&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="SM2GNBLAULSMQ"&gt;
&lt;input type="image" src="https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_cart_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the paypal version of the button can really clash with your color theme. To put your own button in you replace:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="image" src="https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_cart_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With your bootstrap or other button like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form target="paypal" action="https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post"&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick"&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="SM2GNBLAULSMQ"&gt;

&lt;button class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" type="submit" name="submit"&gt;Add To Cart&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Under the email tab for the same form there is a url  <code>https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=SM2GNBLAULSMQ</code> There is a neater integration in many ways that can be done using the url like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=SM2GNBLAULSMQ"&gt;Add To Cart&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There is an email tab under view cart too that makes for this easier to style type of integration.</p>

<div id="forms" class="bookmark">
            <div class="editable" id="articles/INFO2120WebForms_md"><h1>Web Forms</h1>

<p>Canadian Anti Spam Law came into effect July 1, 2014. One of the provisions of that law is that customers must give their consent to receive emails. <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/webform">Web forms</a> are an excellent way to collect and record that consent. If <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/smtp">SMTP auth</a> is also used, consent can be recorded through a contact form that emails customer service. For instance data from a contact form might look like this:</p>

<p>Showing all results. 2 results total.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th></th>
  <th>Submitted</th>
  <th>User</th>
  <th>IP Address</th>
  <th>your email</th>
  <th>subject of your inquiry</th>
  <th>your inquiry</th>
  <th>receive emails</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>2</td>
  <td>08/13/2014 - 17:42</td>
  <td>rhildred</td>
  <td>::1</td>
  <td>rhildred@syndicateme.net</td>
  <td>another test</td>
  <td>dunno</td>
  <td>Don't receive emails</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>08/13/2014 - 17:41</td>
  <td>rhildred</td>
  <td>::1</td>
  <td>rhildred@syndicateme.net</td>
  <td>this is a test</td>
  <td>does this work?</td>
  <td>Receive Emails</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>This data can then be saved and used with some sort of mail merge program for CASL compliant emailing.</p>

<p>There are a few things to remember when using webforms:</p>

<ol>
<li>You aren't creating a new content type for users to add content like an article or basic page</li>
<li>You are making a page like a contact page that users can use to send you information</li>
<li>If you want to email the results, you will likely need to send them through a SMTP server like gmail</li>
<li>Setting drupal up as a mail client involves the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/smtp">SMTP Auth</a> Drupal module (instructions for this module abound).</li>
</ol>

<p>Web forms are an excellent way to structure communications with your users, while achieving CASL compliance!</p>
