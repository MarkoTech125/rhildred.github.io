## Relational Database

![relational database](https://rhildred.github.io/courses/MB115/RelationalDatabase.png "relational database")

A relational database contains tables of related data. The tables have fields that describe what a row in the table represents. Another way that we look at this is that a table (class) contains objects (records) which are described by attributes (fields). In the above case the Driver's license table contains driver's license objects/records described by attributes like `Driver's name`, `Street Address` ....

A key field (primary key) is a special field (or fields) in a record that holds unique data that identifies that record from all the other records in the table and in the database. 

* Often an identifying number, such as social security number or a student ID number.
* Keys are used to sort records in different ways.
* Primary keys must be unique make records distinguishable from one another.
* Foreign keys appear in other tables and usually refer to primary keys in particular tables; they are used to relate one table to another (to cross-reference data).
