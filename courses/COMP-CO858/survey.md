Although there are a number of qualities that people feel that children should have, every person thinks that
some are more important than others. I am going to read you pairs of desirable qualities. Please tell me which
one you think is more important for a child to have.

1. independence versus respect for elders, 
2. obedience versus self-reliance, 
3. curiosity versus good manners
4. being considerate versus well behaved
