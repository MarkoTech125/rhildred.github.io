#System Development Lifecycle/ Open Unified Process

Rich Hildred - rhildred@wlu.ca - 519-594-0900

![notes](slidenotestart://)

How can we work together as a team? Excellent question! The Open Unified Process is one way for teams, possibly spanning a whole organization, to work together on software.

#We covered the Systems Development Life Cycle in MB115

![notes](slidenotestart://)

###From Williams and Sawyer

Systems analysis and design is a
six-phase problem-solving procedure
for examining an information
system and improving it. 

* The six phases make up what is called
the systems development life cycle.

* The systems development life
cycle (SDLC) is the step-by-step
process that many organizations
follow during systems analysis
and design.

#Preliminary Analysis

![notes](slidenotestart://)

1. Conduct preliminary analysis. This
includes stating the objectives,
defining the nature and scope of
the problem.
2. Propose alternative solutions:
leave system alone, make it more
efficient, or build a new system.
3. Describe costs and benefits of
each solution.
4. Submit a preliminary plan with
recommendations.

#Systems Analysis

![notes](slidenotestart://)

1. Gather data, using tools of
 written documents, inter-
 views, questionnaires, and
 observations.
2. Analyze the data, using
 modeling tools: grid charts,
 decision tables, data flow
 diagrams, systems flow-
 charts, connectivity
 diagrams.
3. Write a report.

#Systems Design

![notes](slidenotestart://)

1. Do a preliminary design, using
 CASE tools, prototyping tools,
 and project management software, among others.
2. Do a detail design, defining
 requirements for output, input,
 storage, and processing and
 system controls and backup.
3. Write a report.

#Systems Development

![notes](slidenotestart://)

1. Develop or acquire the development
 software.
2. Acquire the hardware.
3. Test the system.

#Systems Implementation

![notes](slidenotestart://)

1. Convert hardware, software,
 and files through one of four
 types of conversions: direct,
 parallel, phased, or pilot.
    * Direct implementation: This means that the user simply stops using the
    old system and starts using the new one. The risk of this method should be
    evident: What if the new system doesnâ€™t work? If the old system has truly
    been discontinued, there is nothing to fall back on.
    * Parallel implementation: This means that the old and new systems are
    operated side by side until the new system has shown it is reliable, at which
    time the old system is discontinued. Obviously there are benefits in taking
    this cautious approach. If the new system fails, the organization can switch
    back to the old one. The difficulty with this method is the expense of paying
    for the equipment and people to keep two systems going at the same time.
    * Phased implementation: This means that parts of the new system are
    phased in separately ... either at different times (parallel) or all at once in
    groups (direct).
    * Pilot implementation: This means that the entire system is tried out,
    but only by some users. Once the reliability has been proved, the system 
2. Train the users.

#Systems Maintenance

![notes](slidenotestart://)

**Phase 6**, systems maintenance, adjusts and improves the system by having
system audits and periodic evaluations and by making changes based on
new conditions. Even with the conversion accomplished
and the users trained, the system won't just run itself. There is a sixth and
continuous phase in which the information system must be monitored to
ensure that it is successful. Maintenance includes not only keeping the machinery
running but also updating and upgrading the system to keep pace with new
products, services, customers, government regulations, and other requirements.
After some time, maintenance costs will accelerate as attempts continue to
keep the system responsive to user needs. 

At some point, these maintenance costs become excessive, indicating that it may be time to start the entire SDLC
again.
