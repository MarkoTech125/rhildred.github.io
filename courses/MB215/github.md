# ... how do we work together on this

![git version control](https:///rhildred.github.io/courses/MB215/github.svg "git version control")

On one of the first classes, someone asked, "How do we work together on this?" As we have progressed through the materials you will have seen that the answer is, "it depends." According to Cockburn it depends on the criticality and number of people involved in the project.

According to Beck it depends on the "question" that the software is designed to answer:

**1) Will people use this?**

**2) Will people pay for this?**

* Building software to answer these questions involves just hacking something up ... a **minimum viable product**. We have the luxury of no users so this can be a pure experiment. That is we don't have to think about whether our experiment affects existing users, when there aren't any.

**3) Can more people use this?**

* Building software to answer this question requires tests to make sure that we don't break anything for the people that are already using this.

**4) Can another 10 times as many people use this?**

* Building software to answer this requires software engineering and processes of the type that were discussed in the previous lecture.

**5) How long can we keep this going, and make money from it?**

Common to all of these approaches is the need to do version control. More and more at the center of version control is git.
