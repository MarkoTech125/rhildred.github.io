##Required Text

**Specification By Example: How Successful Teams Deliver the Right Software**, Gojko Adzic, June 2011 ISBN 9781617290084, Manning 

##Course Overview

The objective of this course is to familiarize students with software application development processes and underlying concepts. Topics covered include object oriented analysis and design, software development life cycles, models and methodologies, quality assurance and improvement, and the basics of tools used for application development such as requirement management tools, version control, and defect tracking.

Coverage of each topic will be at an introductory level, with the starting assumption that students have no existing knowledge in that area. This course will give students the confidence to discuss software development process intelligently with others, and to solve basic software problems as part of a team.

##Class Format

The course will be held in the interactive classroom. Students will participate in groups in various software development activities, after having a demonstration by the instructor.

##Attendance Expectations

In registering for MB215 you have committed to the scheduled class times. My expectation is that you will attend every class. The lectures and activities will sometimes be based on the textbook, but not always. The activities will often be based in content delivered during the preceding activities. If you miss a class you may be unable to complete the associated activities

Information will often be given in class about upcoming classes, test information, and project information. If you miss class, it is your responsibility to find a fellow student who is willing to update you on what content was covered and information provided. I do not provide lecture notes, summaries, or updates to students who have missed classes.

You are expected to be in class, but I understand that situations, such as illness or a death in the family, do arise. If you are going to miss class, please email me or tell me in advance.
