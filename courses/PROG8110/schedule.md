Programming: Mobile Application Development
=================

When we started [Programming: Web Design and Development](PROG8020), I mentioned that a number of students had done their capstones in phonegap with php back-ends. In this course we will focus on the front end development of mobile application development. We will also take a brief look at the node.js javascript back end. This is not to replace the php back-end approach, but to supplement it with engine.io which enables instant messaging between devices and web apps.

The assignment and final project are of your choice. For the assignment, my main goal is to see everyone in class get something on their phone. For the final project, I am looking for something that reaches off of the device to some sort of webservice for information. This *does not* need to be a webservice of your own construction.
