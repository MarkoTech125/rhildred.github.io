Programming: Web Design and Development
=======================================

A number of CAD teams implemented their CAPSTONE projects in phonegap with a php/mysql backend. This is an attractive platform, because php and mysql are readily available on the internet for free. When the teams chose this technology combination they were able to get something that they could show to their customers very quickly.

In this course, last year, I spent way too long on environment. This time I am going to start with a simpler environment and build up to puting it live on the internet. We have 16 weeks together by my calculation, loosely broken down as follows:

week|content|references
--|--|--
1|building blocks of PHP| notes
2|mysql|notes
3-4|parameters| notes
5-6|php api
6|midterm ... October 9th, 3-4
7|javascript primitives
8|jQuery
9|javascript framework
10|openshift/git
